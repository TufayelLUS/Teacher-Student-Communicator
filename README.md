# Teacher-Student-Communicator
Android project submitted in the university for the 3rd year project submission.
<br>
Developed by: Me with my team mate Mehrab.<br>
This android app is developed based on communication between teacher and student. The aim behind this app is to save time of both teacher and student. It is developed only for Undergraduate level. So that teacher can send notice, assignments, attach zip folder. Departmental head can send notice to department. Student can ask for appointment to the teachers. During registration regular teacher should enter 123 on "key field" and for departmental head it should be 456. We used this part so that no random person can register as a teacher.<br>
Leading University, Sylhet is used as demo university for this app.
